# Occu.py

Occu.py was the title of my Final Year Project at University. I made an eye-tracking system to gather data on a 
batsman's gaze, saccades and pupil dilations, and correlated that with a batsman's skill level. I am now rewriting 
the whole project from ground up to make it an all-encompassing library of computer vision applications.
